# Quick Fix - نشاط قطع الغيار Not Working on Railway

## The Issue
Activity widget shows "لا توجد أنشطة مسجلة" on production because the database table doesn't exist.

## The Quickest Fix (30 seconds)

### Method 1: Force Redeploy
```bash
# In your project folder
git commit --allow-empty -m "Run migrations"
git push
```

Wait for Railway to redeploy. The migration will run automatically.

### Method 2: Railway CLI (If you have it)
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway link
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Method 3: Railway Dashboard
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Open your project
3. Click backend service
4. Click "Deployments"
5. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment

## What to Check After
1. Wait for deployment to finish (~2-3 minutes)
2. Check logs for: `✅ Database migrations applied`
3. Go to your app: https://after-sales-management-production.up.railway.app/storage
4. Edit any spare part
5. Activity should appear in the widget!

## Still Not Working?

Check the detailed guide: `FIX_PRODUCTION_ACTIVITIES.md`

## Why This Happened

Your local dev uses SQLite (file database) ✅
Your production uses PostgreSQL (Railway database) ❌ Missing table

The migration file exists but wasn't run on production yet.

---

**TL;DR: Just redeploy and the migration will run automatically!**
