# üö® Railway Deployment Failure Fix

## üîç Current Status
**Error**: "Application failed to respond" with Request ID: `VeoPlUfMSUiUVGQD0-QtfA`

This means Railway successfully deployed your code, but the application is **crashing on startup**.

## üîß Immediate Diagnosis Steps

### Step 1: Check Railway Logs
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Find your project
3. Click on the **backend service**
4. Go to **Logs** tab
5. Look for error messages like:
   - `Error: Cannot find module`
   - `DATABASE_URL not set`
   - `Migration failed`
   - `Port already in use`
   - `Out of memory`

### Step 2: Check Build Logs
1. In Railway dashboard, go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Check **Build Logs** for errors during build process

## üö® Common Causes & Fixes

### Cause 1: Missing Dependencies
**Error**: `Cannot find module '@prisma/client'` or similar
**Fix**: 
```bash
# Check if all dependencies are in package.json
# Make sure devDependencies are not needed in production
```

### Cause 2: Database Connection Issues
**Error**: `connect ECONNREFUSED` or `DATABASE_URL not set`
**Fix**:
```bash
# Check Railway environment variables
railway variables

# Ensure DATABASE_URL is set correctly
```

### Cause 3: Migration Failures
**Error**: `Migration failed` or `Table already exists`
**Fix**:
```bash
# Reset database and apply migrations
railway run npx prisma migrate reset --force
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Cause 4: Port Binding Issues
**Error**: `EADDRINUSE` or `Port already in use`
**Fix**: Check your production start script

### Cause 5: Memory/CPU Limits
**Error**: `Out of memory` or `Process killed`
**Fix**: Scale up resources in Railway dashboard

## üöÄ Quick Fix Attempts

### Fix 1: Force New Deployment
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force redeploy - fix startup crash"
git push
```

### Fix 2: Check Environment Variables
```bash
# List all Railway variables
railway variables

# Check if these are set:
# - DATABASE_URL
# - JWT_SECRET  
# - NODE_ENV=production
```

### Fix 3: Manual Database Reset
```bash
# Connect to Railway database
railway connect postgres

# Or reset via Railway CLI
railway run npx prisma migrate reset --force
```

### Fix 4: Check Start Command
Your `railway.json` should have:
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm run start:prod"
  }
}
```

## üîç Debugging Commands

### Check Service Status
```bash
railway status
```

### View Live Logs
```bash
railway logs --tail
```

### Test Database Connection
```bash
railway run npx prisma db push
```

### Check Build Process
```bash
railway run npm run build
```

## üìã Troubleshooting Checklist

- [ ] Railway logs show specific error messages
- [ ] All environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Database is accessible and migrations applied
- [ ] Build process completes successfully
- [ ] Start command is correct in railway.json
- [ ] Memory/CPU limits are sufficient
- [ ] No conflicting ports or services

## üéØ Most Likely Issues

Based on your recent changes, the most likely causes are:

1. **Migration Issues**: The SparePartHistory table might not exist in production
2. **Database Connection**: PostgreSQL connection string might be wrong
3. **Missing Environment Variables**: JWT_SECRET or DATABASE_URL not set
4. **Build Failures**: TypeScript compilation errors

## üö® Emergency Fix

If nothing else works:

```bash
# 1. Reset everything
railway run npx prisma migrate reset --force

# 2. Apply schema directly
railway run npx prisma db push

# 3. Seed the database
railway run npx prisma db seed

# 4. Restart the service
railway restart
```

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Check Railway logs first** - this will tell us exactly what's wrong
2. **Share the error messages** from the logs
3. **Try the quick fixes** above
4. **If still failing**, we'll need to see the specific error messages

---

**The code fixes are correct - this is a deployment/infrastructure issue. Once we fix the startup crash, everything will work perfectly!**
