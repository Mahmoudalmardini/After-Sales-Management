## Deployment Steps

### 1. Railway/Docker Deployment
The Docker build should now succeed with the following stages:

```dockerfile
# Frontend build
RUN cd frontend && npm install && npm run build

# Backend setup
RUN cd backend && npm install
RUN cd backend && npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your deployment environment:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - JWT secret key
- `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` - Refresh token secret
- `PORT` - Backend port (default: 3001)
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"
- `CORS_ORIGIN` - Your frontend URL

### 3. Database Migration
After deployment, run migrations on production:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Testing
1. **Test Request Management**
   - Create a request
   - Close the request
   - Assign a technician â†’ Should auto-reopen
   - Check activity logs

2. **Test Spare Parts**
   - Create a spare part
   - Update fields (name, price, quantity, etc.)
   - Check history modal â†’ Should show all changes
   - View activity widget â†’ Should display recent activities

3. **Test UI**
   - Check table responsiveness
   - Verify action buttons are readable
   - Test filtering in activity widget
   - Verify recently updated items are highlighted

## Known Issues (Non-Blocking)
- Minor ESLint warning about unused `storageAPI` import in `RequestDetailsPage.tsx` (false positive)
- This doesn't affect functionality or deployment

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Previous migration can be rolled back
2. SparePartHistory feature is optional and can be disabled
3. Frontend build is backward compatible

## Success Criteria
âœ… All builds pass without errors
âœ… Database migrations apply successfully  
âœ… All features working as expected
âœ… No performance degradation
âœ… UI improvements visible to users
