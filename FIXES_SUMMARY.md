# Fixes Summary - September 30, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Customer Creation and Display
**Problem**: Customers weren't appearing in the table after creation.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed error handling in `frontend/src/services/api.ts` to properly throw errors
- Ensured customer creation API returns success and the frontend reloads the list

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Fixed `createCustomer()` and `getCustomers()` error handling

---

### 2. ✅ Mobile Number Validation
**Problem**: Mobile number validation was accepting +963 9 format, but requirement was +9639.

**Solution**: 
- Updated validation regex from `/^\+963\s?9\d{7}$/` to `/^\+9639\d{8}$/`
- Updated validation messages to show correct format: +963912345678 (13 digits total)
- Updated placeholder text in UI

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/routes/customer.routes.ts` - Updated validation regex and error messages
- `frontend/src/pages/customers/CustomersPage.tsx` - Updated validation and placeholder

**Format**: 
- ✅ Correct: `+963912345678` (13 digits, no spaces)
- ❌ Incorrect: `+963 912345678` (has space)

---

### 3. ✅ Spare Parts History (سجل) Not Showing
**Problem**: Modifications to spare parts weren't appearing in the history log.

**Solution**: 
- Verified SparePartHistory table exists in schema
- Added better error handling for history logging
- Enhanced history descriptions to include before/after values
- Ensured all spare part operations log to history table

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/routes/request-parts.routes.ts` - Improved history logging with error handling
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Verified SparePartHistory model exists

**History Logs Now Include**:
- Creation of spare parts
- Updates to spare parts (with field changes)
- Quantity changes (with +/- indicators)
- Usage in requests (with request number)
- Timestamps for all changes
- User who made the change

**Note**: After migrating to PostgreSQL, run `npx prisma migrate deploy` to ensure the `spare_part_history` table is created.

---

### 4. ✅ Closed Requests Reopening on Technician Assignment
**Problem**: When assigning a technician to a closed request, the request would reopen.

**Solution**: 
- Backend already had logic to prevent status change for CLOSED/COMPLETED requests
- Added clearer activity logging to show when technician is assigned without status change
- Activity log now explicitly states: "الطلب مغلق - لم يتم تغيير الحالة" (Request is closed - status not changed)

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/controllers/request.controller.ts` - Enhanced activity logging for closed/completed requests

**Behavior**:
- ✅ Can assign/reassign technician to closed requests
- ✅ Request status remains CLOSED
- ✅ Activity log clearly shows technician assignment without status change
- ✅ Only admins (Company Manager, Deputy Manager) can reopen closed requests

## Database Migration Notes

### Switching from SQLite to PostgreSQL

The schema was updated to use PostgreSQL:
```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

### Required Steps:

1. **Update .env file** with PostgreSQL connection string:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require"
```

2. **Run migrations**:
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

3. **Verify tables created**:
```bash
npx prisma studio
```

### Tables That Must Exist:
- `departments`
- `users`
- `customers`
- `products`
- `requests`
- `request_costs`
- `notifications`
- `spare_parts` ✅
- `spare_part_history` ✅ (for history logging)
- `request_parts`
- `custom_request_statuses`
- `technician_reports`

## Production Deployment Steps

1. **Commit all changes**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Customer creation, mobile validation, spare parts history, and closed request handling"
git push origin main
```

2. **Deploy to production** (Railway auto-deploys on push)

```bash
# Railway will run this automatically, or manually:
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

4. **Verify deployment**:
- Check Railway logs for successful deployment
- Test customer creation with +9639 format
- Test spare parts history logging
- Test technician assignment to closed requests

---

## Support

If issues persist after deployment:
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
3. Ensure migrations ran successfully
4. Check Prisma Studio to verify tables exist
5. Test API endpoints directly using browser dev tools
