# Department Management Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete department management system that allows admins and supervisors to create, edit, and delete departments. Departments can be assigned to products and spare parts.

## What Was Implemented

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Updated Department Routes (`backend/src/routes/department.routes.ts`)
- Added authentication middleware to all routes
- **POST `/api/departments`** - Create new department
  - Validates required fields (name is required)
  - Checks for duplicate department names
  - Restricted to: COMPANY_MANAGER, DEPUTY_MANAGER, DEPARTMENT_MANAGER, SECTION_SUPERVISOR
  
- **PUT `/api/departments/:id`** - Update existing department
  - Validates department exists
  - Checks for duplicate names (excluding current department)
  - Updates name and description
  - Same role restrictions as POST
  
- **DELETE `/api/departments/:id`** - Delete department
  - Validates department exists
  - **Prevents deletion if department is in use** by:
    - Users
    - Products
    - Spare Parts
    - Requests
  - Returns detailed error message showing what's using the department
  - Same role restrictions as POST

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Added TypeScript Types (`frontend/src/types/index.ts`)
```typescript
export interface CreateDepartmentForm {
  name: string;
  description?: string;
}

export interface UpdateDepartmentForm extends CreateDepartmentForm {
  id: number;
}
```

#### 2. Added Department API Methods (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`)
- `createDepartment(data)` - Create new department
- `updateDepartment(id, data)` - Update existing department
- `deleteDepartment(id)` - Delete department

#### 3. Created Departments Page (`frontend/src/pages/departments/DepartmentsPage.tsx`)
Features:
- **Department List Table** showing:
  - Department name
  - Description
  - Created date
  - Actions (Edit/Delete) for authorized users
  
- **Create/Edit Form** with:
  - Name field (required)
  - Description field (optional)
  - Form validation
  - Loading states
  
- **Delete Confirmation**:
  - Shows confirmation dialog
  - Displays user-friendly error if department is in use
  
- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - Only authorized roles can create/edit/delete
  - Proper error messages for unauthorized actions
  
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Works on mobile and desktop
  - Follows existing UI patterns from CustomersPage and ProductsPage

#### 4. Updated Sidebar (`frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`)
- Added "Departments" menu item with BuildingOfficeIcon
- Positioned between "Products" and "Accounts"
- Visible to: COMPANY_MANAGER, DEPUTY_MANAGER, DEPARTMENT_MANAGER, SECTION_SUPERVISOR

#### 5. Updated App Routes (`frontend/src/App.tsx`)
- Added `/departments` route with DepartmentsPage component
- Protected with authentication
- Wrapped in DashboardLayout

## User Experience

### For Admins and Supervisors:
1. **Navigate to Departments** from the sidebar
2. **View all departments** in a clean table
3. **Create new department**:
   - Click "Add Department" button
   - Fill in name (required) and description (optional)
   - Click "Create Department"
4. **Edit existing department**:
   - Click "Edit" button on any department
   - Modify name or description

   - If department is in use, see detailed error message

### When Creating Products/Spare Parts:
- Admins and supervisors can now select from available departments
- The dropdown shows all departments created in the system

## Error Handling

### Backend Validation:
- ✅ Name is required
- ✅ Name must be unique
- ✅ Cannot delete department if in use
- ✅ Detailed usage information in error messages

### Frontend Error Display:
- ✅ Shows all backend error messages
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Loading states during operations
- ✅ Success/failure feedback

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create Department**:
   - Try creating with just name
   - Try creating with name and description
   - Try creating duplicate name (should fail)

2. **Edit Department**:
   - Change name and description
   - Try changing to duplicate name (should fail)

3. **Delete Department**:
   - Delete unused department (should succeed)
   - Try deleting department with products (should fail with message)
   - Try deleting department with users (should fail with message)

4. **Role-Based Access**:
   - Login as COMPANY_MANAGER (should see and manage departments)
   - Login as TECHNICIAN (should NOT see departments menu)
   - Login as WAREHOUSE_KEEPER (should NOT see departments menu)

5. **Integration Testing**:
   - Create department
   - Assign it to a product
   - Try to delete the department (should fail)
   - Create a spare part and assign the department
   - Verify spare parts are properly linked
