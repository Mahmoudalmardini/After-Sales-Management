# Warehouse Keeper UI Improvements

## Date: 2025-09-30

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Fixed Distorted Action Buttons**
- **Before:** Text-only buttons (تعديل, حذف, سجل) that looked cramped and distorted
- **After:** Properly styled buttons with:
  - Icons for each action (✏️ Edit, 📋 History, 🗑️ Delete)
  - Colored backgrounds (Blue for edit, Green for history, Red for delete)
  - Proper padding and spacing
  - Hover effects for better interactivity

#### 2. **Improved Table UI**
- Enhanced table appearance with:
  - Rounded corners and shadow for better depth
  - Gradient header background
  - Larger, more readable header text
  - Better row hover effects with blue highlight
  - Improved spacing between elements
  - Visual indicator for recently updated items (yellow background)

#### 3. **Fixed Empty History Issue**
- **Problem:** SparePartHistory table didn't exist in the database
- **Solution:** 
  - Created database migration to add SparePartHistory table
  - Added proper error handling and logging
  - Verified history is being created correctly

#### 4. **Created Spare Parts Activity Widget**
- **New Component:** `SparePartsActivity.tsx`

  - Real-time activity feed showing all spare parts operations
  - Filter options: Today, This Week, All
  - Color-coded activities:
    - 🆕 Green for new items

    - 📦 Yellow for quantity changes
    - 🔧 Red for parts used in requests
  - Shows old → new values for changes
  - Displays who made the change and when
  - Auto-refresh capability
  - Responsive design
