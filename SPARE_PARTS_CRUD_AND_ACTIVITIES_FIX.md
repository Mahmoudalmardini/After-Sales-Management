# 🔧 Spare Parts CRUD & Activities Fix

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Spare Parts Deletion Issue
**Problem**: When deleting spare parts, the deletion wasn't being logged in the activity history.

**Root Cause**: The deletion endpoint was missing the `logSparePartHistory` call.

**Solution**: 
- Added deletion logging BEFORE deleting the spare part
- Added 'DELETED' change type to the schema and frontend
- Added proper deletion icon (🗑️) and red color styling

### 2. ❌ Empty Activities Widget Issue  
**Problem**: "نشاط قطع الغيار" (Spare Parts Activity) widget was empty on production.

**Root Cause**: Backend default filter was set to `'today'` but frontend was sending `'all'` as default.

**Solution**:
- Changed backend default filter from `'today'` to `'all'` 
- This ensures activities show up immediately when the widget loads

## 📁 Files Modified

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

3. Check if deletion is logged in activities widget
4. Verify deletion shows 🗑️ icon with red styling

### ✅ Activities Widget  
1. Go to Storage page
2. Check "نشاط قطع الغيار" widget
3. Should show activities immediately (not empty)
4. Try different filters: اليوم, هذا الأسبوع, الكل

### ✅ CRUD Operations
1. **Create**: Add new spare part → should log creation
2. **Read**: View spare parts → should work normally  
3. **Update**: Edit spare part → should log changes
4. **Delete**: Delete spare part → should log deletion

## 🔍 What Each Activity Type Shows
