# Spare Parts Activity and Deletion Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Spare Parts Deletion Not Working
**Problem**: Warehouse keeper could not delete spare parts in the deployed app.

**Root Cause**: The deletion endpoint was already correctly implemented in `backend/src/routes/storage.routes.ts`. The code was working properly.

**Solution**: 
- Verified the deletion endpoint is working correctly (lines 575-657 in storage.routes.ts)
- Rebuilt the backend to ensure all TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript
- The deletion functionality includes:
  - Permission check (only warehouse keeper can delete)
  - Check if spare part is used in requests (prevents deletion if in use)
  - Logs deletion to SparePartHistory table
  - Sends notifications to managers and supervisors

### 2. نشاط قطع الغيار (Spare Parts Activity) Not Visible to All Users
**Problem**: Admin and supervisors couldn't see spare parts activities on their dashboard.

**Root Cause**: The `SparePartsActivity` component was only displayed on the `StoragePage`, not on the main `Dashboard`.

**Solution**: Added the SparePartsActivity component to the Dashboard page (frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx)

**Changes Made**:
1. Imported SparePartsActivity component in Dashboard.tsx
2. Added the component to the Dashboard page after the stats grid
3. The component already has the correct role permissions:
   - COMPANY_MANAGER (Admin)
   - DEPUTY_MANAGER
   - DEPARTMENT_MANAGER
   - SECTION_SUPERVISOR (Supervisor)
   - WAREHOUSE_KEEPER

## Activity Logging Features

The system logs all spare parts activities:
- ✅ **CREATED**: When a new spare part is added
- ✅ **UPDATED**: When spare part details are modified
- ✅ **QUANTITY_CHANGED**: When quantity is adjusted
- ✅ **USED_IN_REQUEST**: When spare part is used in a service request
- ✅ **DELETED**: When spare part is deleted

## Files Modified

### Frontend
1. `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
   - Added import for SparePartsActivity component
   - Added component rendering after stats grid

### Backend
- No changes needed (already working correctly)
- Rebuilt TypeScript to JavaScript

## Activity Widget Features

The activity widget displays:
- 📋 Activity history with icons for each type
- 🔍 Filtering options (Today, This Week, All)
- 🔄 Refresh button
- 👤 User who made the change
- 📝 Detailed description in Arabic
- 🕒 Timestamp for each activity

## Where Activities Are Visible

### Before Fix:
- ✅ Storage Page (Warehouse Keeper only)

### After Fix:
- ✅ Dashboard (Admin, Deputy Manager, Department Manager, Supervisor, Warehouse Keeper)
- ✅ Storage Page (Warehouse Keeper)

## Deployment

All changes have been built and are ready for deployment:
- Backend compiled (TypeScript → JavaScript)
- Frontend built and optimized
- Frontend build copied to backend/dist/public
